# My portfolio

I used HTML, CSS.

## Part 1: Choosing the elements
To make the HTML clean code, I used nav, main, header, section and span tags. I wanted different routes which I made them using <a> and <template> tags.

## Part 2: The HTML
I wrote the code sequentially by dividing each container one by one. The template tags doesn't display anything but can be used to insert its content into another using css. I also downloaded the icons from official sites.

## Part 3: The CSS
The CSS is what makes this portfolio feel alive. With complementing light blue and white colors, I was able to make a nice theme. To make the clicked button effect on the <a> tag, I used css to add a class to the element which changes the background color. I also discovered that the !important specification in the external css overrides the other css methods.

## Part 4: Responsiveness

Using flex wrap along with media query I was able to make it responsive. Because of not enough space to display the about tab (aside tag), I hid it and made another route appear on the nav bar (About page). Because of this, I also had to automatically make it reappear when the window resizes.
